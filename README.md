## Description

The cross-course project was a year-long project, spanning all courses in my first year of study. Throughout this project I learned how to properly plan/design a project with the target audience in mind, how to perform user testing and how to work with headless WordPress APIs. I also improved my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills. I could choose between 3 briefs, and I chose GameHub. GameHub is an online store where you can buy new/used games. The website consists of 11 pages:
- A home page showing some featured/recommended games to the user.
- A list of games page showing all available games. The user can sort through the games using a search input, radio buttons for category, and a select for sorting by featured, alphabetical, price low-high/high-low and user review. The user can also add games to their cart.
- A game specific page built dynamically based on which game the user selected. This page contains details on the game. The user can also add the game to their cart through this page.
- A contact page where the user can fill out a contact form or view other methods (phone number, social media and email) of contacting GameHub.
- A cart page where the user can view their selected games and remove them.
- A checkout page where the user can fill out a form detailing delivery and card information (only front-end).
- A checkout successful page.
- A login page (only front-end).
- A page for recovering passwords (only front-end).
- A page for creating a new account (only front-end).
- An account page detailing the selected user.

## Built With

If you wish to contribute by sending in feedback, you are welcome to do so. I am relatively new to front-end development, and I am sure there are many improvements to be made. You are also able to submit code to the project, since the project is uploaded on a public GitHub repository. If you want to do so, be sure to open a pull request so the code can be reviewed.
